## Data Structure ##
A **Data Structure** is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs. 

## Algorithm ##
An **Algorithm** is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hence, as the name suggests DSA deals with implementation of different **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** to tackle real world problems.

I am currently working on written notes for all theoritical aspects of DSA. Hope to *complete* this course.  :blush:

## Time Complexity: ##

**Time complexity** of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

Types of notations: 
* O-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic upper bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by O(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-oh of g of
n”. It also known as worst case time complexity as it denotes the upper bound in which algorithm terminates.

* Ω-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic lower bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by Ω(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-omega of
g of n”. It also known as best case time complexity as it denotes the lower bound in which algorithm terminates.

* Θ-notation: It is used to denote the average time of a program.

### Comparison of functions on basis of time complexity: ###
It follows the following order in case of time complexity:

* O(nn) > O(n!) > O(n3) > O(n2) > O(n.log(n)) > O(n.log(log(n))) > O(n) > O(sqrt(n)) > O(log(n)) > O(1)

Note: *Reverse is the order for better performance of a code with corresponding time complexity, i.e. a program with less time complexity is more
efficient.*

## Space Complexity ##

Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by a program to run as a function of length of the input. It is directly
proportional to the largest memory your program acquires at any instance during run time.
