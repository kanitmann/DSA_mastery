## Data Structure ##
A **Data Structure** is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs. 

## Algorithm ##
An **Algorithm** is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.

Hence, as the name suggests DSA deals with implementation of different **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** to tackle real world problems.

I am currently working on written notes for all theoritical aspects of DSA. Hope to *complete* this course.  :simple_smile:
